    "\n",
    "- **Perplexity Analysis**: Utilizes the GPT-2 language model to calculate the perplexity of code snippets. Lower perplexity values often indicate AI-generated code due to the model's familiarity with such patterns.\n",

    "- **Caching for Speed**: Implements LRU caching to accelerate repeated analysis and improve scalability for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Singleton Model Loading**: Ensures models are loaded only once per session, reducing memory usage and initialization time.\n",
    "- **Batch and Parallel Processing**: Supports efficient batch analysis and parallel execution for rapid review of multiple code samples.\n",

    "## Plagiarism Detection Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "This section details the approach used for detecting plagiarism in code submissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Algorithm Patterns**: The detector checks submitted code against a set of well-known algorithmic patterns (e.g., quicksort, binary search, bubble sort, merge sort, recursive Fibonacci).\n",
    "- **Hash-Based Matching**: Each pattern is pre-processed and stored as a hash for fast exact matching. If a code snippet matches a known pattern hash, it is flagged as an exact match.\n",
    "- **Similarity Analysis**: For non-exact matches, the detector uses sequence similarity to compare code structure and logic, flagging submissions with high similarity scores.\n",
    "- **Source Attribution**: When plagiarism is detected, the system reports the sources (e.g., StackOverflow, GitHub, LeetCode) where the matching pattern is commonly found.\n",
    "- **Performance**: The logic is optimized for speed using caching and early termination, making it suitable for large-scale automated code review.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This modular approach allows for easy extension with new patterns and sources, and can be integrated into backend services for real-time plagiarism detection."
